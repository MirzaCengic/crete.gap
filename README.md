# Crete gap analysis project
## Description
This repo contains some useful function and workflow scripts wrapped in a package that facilitates Crete gap analysis.

### Currently implemented:
- [ ] Create pseudo-absences that account for sampling bias

### Not implemented
##### Still necessary to push to github (maybe it's necessary to put it into the package like this since the scripts contain the workflow?!? Instead call this package in scripts and make separate repo for workflow?!?)
- [ ] Data preparation scripts
- [ ] biomod scripts and biomod parallel processing (for milkun cluster) scripts
- [ ] Zonation analysis workflow
- [ ] Plotting stuff
